Okay. I was bored and I wanted to learn about you can create your own discord Bot. I made this project for fun and I'm still going to be updating it to this day

Currently has around 18 - 20 Features: and a whole lot more future updates, 2 Bugged Feature which I will fix later

The code isn't the best as I am a beginner still learning, however I will try my best to make my code cleaner.

It also has secret Nukebot Functionality (Only for educational purposes)

To use this Bot:

    Create your own discord bot, Set up Administrator perms (best use case to use commands), And tick every Privileged Gateway Intents.

    Inside the code, change the ENV File token to your own discord token

    Change the GUILD ID and in the on ready change that ID aswell.

    Make sure you have python installed and all the required packages + the discord py package.

    After all of that, should be ready to use

Current Lines 502 (With secret nukebot 602)

Time spent on project 1 week

Future Updates: ticket Close request, Tictactoe games, Image manipulation commands like adding logos, creating gifs, Moderation Database To set up a moderattion system, music playing system (bugged atm), anti alt system.

(IF UR HERE FOR NUKEBOT, DONT USE FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES PLS U CAN CUSTOMISE EVERYTHING AT THE VERY BOTTOM).
